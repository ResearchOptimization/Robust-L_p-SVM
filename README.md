# Robust-L_p-SVM
This study presents a robust classification framework with embedded feature selection to tackle challenges in high-dimensional datasets.  The proposed methods are validated on benchmark datasets using four classification models and two feature elimination techniques: Direct Feature Elimination and Recursive Feature Elimination.
